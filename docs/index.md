## Icons8 — icons, illustrations, photos

**Icons8 — icons, illustrations, photos** is our Figma plugin which has a library of icons, photos, and illustrations:

* **Icons:** pixel-perfect icons in 40+ styles. All icons in PNG up to 100px are free, plus there are some free SVG categories too;
* **Illustrations:** flat and 3D, vector and raster illustrations. Low-resolution PNGs are free;
* **Photos:** people, objects, and animals, ready-to-use shots, and background-free elements. Low-resolution JPGs are free.

### Search

You can search for icons, photos, and illustrations by keywords via the search bar located at the top of the plugin window. To add an asset to your artboard, click on it or drag and drop it onto the canvas:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.1_Icons8_Search.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also browse icons by topic. For this, click on the **folder button** and choose a **category**:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.2_Categories.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Use tabs to switch between icons, illustrations, and photos:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.3_Icons8_Switch.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Find visually consistent icons by selecting **styles**:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.4_Styles.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Illustrations search works similarly – you can sort illustrations by **categories**:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.5_Categories (1).mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

And by **styles** too:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.6_Illustrations Search Styles.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also sort illustrations by **categories and styles at once** – this option will become available if you choose ‘Categories’ first:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.7_Icons8_Ilustrations.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

As for photo search, you can turn on different filters (gender, age, category, etc.) by clicking on the icon in the right corner of the search bar:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.8_Icons8_Photo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Other features

**Adding assets to canvas**

You can add icons, photos and illustrations by clicking on them once. It’s also possible to place icons on your canvas by drag’n’dropping them:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/2.9_Canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

**Changing the size of an icon**

Adjust icon size in the drop-down next to the icon style. The size that you choose will be automatically applied to all icons:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.3_Change.png">
</p>

**Switching between formats**

The dropdown next to the size menu will allow you to choose between PNG and SVG formats. The SVG format is a paid option that allows scaling and editing. There are three categories that have free SVGs: Popular, Characters, and Logos.

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.4_Format.png">
</p>

> Keep in mind that commercial usage of icons from Logo and Characters categories should be permitted by the rightful owners of respective trademarks.

**Recoloring icons**

You can adjust icon colors right from the plugin. Just click on the color circle and choose an option from the default ones or create your own color. Please take note that it’s not possible to recolor styles that are already in color:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.5._Recolor.png">
</p>

Here's how you can add a 'lock' icon to your locked screen mockup with those features:


<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/Icons8_Demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### License

There are both free and paid assets in our plugin. Professional users prefer SVG format that provides unlimited scaling and editing. In order to download this format you need one of our subscription plans, check them out [here](https://icons8.com/pricing).

You can also download and use icons, illustrations and photos without purchasing them if you add attribution. More info on how to do this here.

Material Design Icons is a Figma plugin that has more than 35,000 icons in PNG and SVG. All icons are divided into two sections: icons by Google and icons by Icons8.

As you can see, working with icons from our Material Design is pretty easy. Here's an example:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/Material_Demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Background Remover

Our Background Remover Figma plugin will allow you to remove background from one or many images at once. Here’s how you can do it.

### Removing background

Select one picture or a batch, or simply everything you have on canvas:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.11_Remover.png">
</p>

Run the Background Remover from the **Plugins** menu:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.10_Remover.png">
</p>

Get images without backgrounds, but with the original image size and quality. Keep in mind that Background Remover works with images up to 5MB:

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="auto" src="/public/1.9_Remover.png">
</p>

Here's a quick video of removing background from the image on a mobile browser mockup:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/BG Remover_Demo 15.47.57.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

In case you want to use Background Remover outside of Figma, we also have a web app with the extended functionality, you can find it [here](https://icons8.com/bgremover/).
